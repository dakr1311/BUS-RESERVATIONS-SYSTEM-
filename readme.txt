  <---- BUS Reservation System ---->

The code is a class that has three members: b_no,b_name, and d_name.
The first member is the bus number.
The second member is the name of the bus stop (e.g., "Bus Stop 1").
The third member is the name of the destination (e.g., "Destination 1").
The Addbus() function adds a new bus to this system by adding its number to an array called buses in which there are already two elements: 0 and 1.
This function also creates a new string object called b_name for storing information about this newly added bus stop's name and another string object called d_name for storing information about this newly added destination's name.
It then stores these objects into their respective members of BusManegmentSystem::b_no, BusManegmentSystem::d_name, and BusManegmentSystem::b_.
The Reservation() function takes one argument which is an integer representing how many seats on that particular bus should be reserved at any given time during its operation; it returns nothing because it does not need anything from outside itself except memory space for temporary storage purposes as well as some other things like creating strings with names corresponding to each
The code is a class declaration of the Bus_Manegment_System.
The b_no,b_name,d_name are private members of the class and cannot be accessed by any other member function.
The b_seat is public and can be accessed by all member functions.
Addbus() adds a new bus to the system while Reservation() reserves seats on that bus for a specific time period.
Show() displays information about buses in the system while Available() displays available buses in the system at any given time.

The code starts by declaring a variable called p. This is the main loop of the program and it will be used to control all other parts of the program.
Next, we declare an fstream file which will be used to store data in later on.
Then we create a string t_no,td_name,tb_name; int t_seat; int found=0; cout<<"\n\t\t----------------Bus Menagment System---------------"; cout<<"\nEnter Bus No :"; cin>>b_no; cout<<" Enter Bus Name :"; cin>>b_name; cout<<"Total Seats :"; cin>>b b _ seat ; cout << " Enter Driver Name: "; cin >>d _ name ; file .
open ( " bus .txt",ios:: in ); if (!
file) { file .
open ( " bus .txt",ios:: app|ios:: out); file << b _ no << " " << b _ name << "\t"<< b _ seat << " " << d _ name ; } else { file >> t_no >> tb_name >> t _ seat >> td-
The code will add a bus to the system.

The code opens the file bus.txt and then reads in the data from it into a variable called t_no. The code then opens another file seat.txt and reads in the data from it into a variable called s_b_no, which is used to count how many times that particular bus number has been taken by passengers on that day. The program will keep looping until either of these two conditions are met: 1) The user presses enter or 2) There is no more data left in either of the files (the end of each file).
The code is used to open a file and read data from it. The first line of the code opens the file using the "ios::app|ios::in" option. If this doesn't work, then an error message will be printed on screen. The next line of the code reads data from the file into a string called t_no. This is done by calling cin>>t_no; Next, a new file is opened with "ios::app|ios::in" option in order to write data into it. In this case, we are opening a new file called seat.txt and writing data into it by calling file>>s_b_no>>s_s_no; Finally
The code starts by opening a file called "b_no" and reading the first line of data from it. The next line reads the second line of data, then the third, etc. until all lines are read in order. If a seat is found to be reserved, that row will have an entry for each person who has been assigned to that seat (i.e., b_name and d_name). The code then closes the file before moving on to analyze other files if there are any left over seats available.
The code will take the data from file and store it in a temporary variable. The code will compare the value of b_no to t_no, if they are equal then the value of b_name is stored in seats. If found is equal to 1 then it means that there is only one seat left, so it prints out "All seats is already reserved......"
The code starts by declaring the variables for the number of seats and the seat numbers. Then it opens a file called "seat.txt" with ios::in mode, which means that it will read from this file in order to store data into an array named ss_no. The code then declares a variable named t_no and assigns its value to be equal to s_b_no (the first seat number) if s_s_no is equal to s-1 (the last seat number). The next line of code reads from the file using ios::app|ios::out mode, which means that it will read from this file in order to store data into an array named ss_no but also write out whatever is stored in ss-1 onto another text file called "seat.txt". This way, when you open up "seat.txt", you can see all of your saved information on one page without having to scroll through multiple pages like before!
The code will write out the seat number into a file called "seat.txt" and then print it to the screen. The code above first checks if the user has entered an invalid seat number, in which case it prints a message to the screen that says "Please try again." If they have entered a valid seat number, then it goes on to open up the file "seat.txt" and writes out their new seat number followed by a comma and their old seat number.

The code starts by declaring the variables found, count, and t_busn. The variable found is initialized to 0. The variable count is initialized to 0. The string t_busn is declared as a character array of length 2 (the first element will be used for input and the second element will be used for output). The code then opens two files: bus.txt and seat.txt using ios::in mode with file1 being opened in read-only mode so that it can only read from the file but not write to it or delete anything from it; this allows us to use both files at once without having them interfere with each other's contents while we are reading them into memory one after another. Next, if either of these files do not exist, they print out an error message on screen telling us that they don't exist before continuing on with their respective operations; otherwise, they ask for user input asking them what bus number they would like entered followed by displaying a prompt asking which seat number you would like entered followed by displaying a prompt asking which seat number you would like entered again because there might have been more than one entry in the previous prompt depending on how many seats were available on your particular bus line when you
The code attempts to read the contents of a file called bus.txt and store it in an array called found. The contents of the file are then displayed on screen as text. The following code reads the contents of a file called seat.txt and stores it in an array called found, which is used to count how many seats exist on the bus system.
The code starts by declaring a variable called file. The code then declares another variable called t_busn. This is the number of the bus that we are managing. Next, it declares two more variables: b_no and b_name. These are the numbers of buses and their names respectively. Next, it starts to loop through all files in a directory until there is no more file left to read from or else eof() returns true (which means that there is nothing left on the line). It does this by using while(!file.eof()) which will keep looping as long as !file has not been declared false (meaning that there's something on the line). It then checks if t_busn == b_no which means checking if they're equal so it can continue with its program flow without any errors occurring later on in its execution process. If they're equal, then system("cls") prints "Bus Management System" at the top of screen before continuing with what comes next; namely printing out how many seats each bus has and how many reserved seats each bus has for passengers who don't show up for their ride because they didn't get off at their stop like they were supposed to do or
The code is an example of a loop that will iterate through the contents of a file. The code starts with the declaration of a variable called file, which stores the contents of the file. Next, there is a while loop that will continue to execute as long as there are more lines in the file. The next part of this snippet is where all variables are declared and initialized. These include b_no, b_name, b_seat, and d_name. Then comes another while loop that will continue to execute until it finds an empty line in the file (the line with no text). If t_busn == b_no then system("cls") is executed and cout<<"\n\t
The code starts by declaring a variable called b_no. This is the bus number that will be used in this program. Next, it declares an integer variable called found and initializes it to 0. The code then starts by reading from the file stream object into the b_name string variable using >> operator. Then, it reads from the file stream object into the d_name string variable using << operator. After that, it prints out "Bus No." on screen with cout<<"\n\n Emty No. Of Seats :". Next, if found==0 then print "Invalid Bus Number" on screen with cout<<"\n\n Bus No. Is Invalid ".
The code attempts to show the available seats on a bus. The code starts with a function called Available() which will be executed when the program is run. This function clears the screen and opens a file for input, then it enters an infinite loop that will read from the file until there are no more seats left in the bus. The value of found is incremented each time a seat is found, so if found==0 at any point during execution, it means there are no more seats left in the bus and execution should stop.
The code starts by declaring the variables that will be used in the program. The first variable is b_no, which is a bus number. The second variable is b_name, which contains the name of the bus. The third variable is d_name, which contains the driver's name for each bus stop. The code then opens up a file called "bus.txt" and starts to read data from it using ios::in(). If there was no error opening up this file, then cout<<"\n\t\t----------------Bus Menagment System---------------"; would print out on screen with heading text about what type of system this program will be running as well as some other information about how many buses are available and their names and total seats and drivers' names at each stop along with some more text after that line to show where you can find more information if needed or just keep reading on to see what else happens next in this program. If there was an error opening up this file (which means something went wrong), then cout<<"\n\n file not open"; would print out on screen instead of whatever else was supposed to happen next in this program because we know that something went wrong when trying
The code is used to read the data from the text file. The first line of code creates a new string called heading and prints it on screen with the help of cout<<"\n\t\t----------------Bus Menagment System---------------"; //heading The next line of code opens a text file called bus.txt using the open function and checks if it is not already opened by checking for an error in return value. If there is no error, then the rest of the lines are executed and printed on screen.

The code starts by declaring a variable called Bus_Manegment_System.
This is the type of object that will be used to represent the bus system.
Next, it declares a variable called choice which will hold the user's input.
The while loop starts by printing "cls" on screen and then prints "***************************************************".
It then prints out "----------------Bus Menagment System---------------" followed by another line of text before finally printing out "Enter your choice:-> ".
The next part of the code is where you can enter your choices for what you want to do with this program.
You have five options: Add bus, Reservation, Show buses available, Exit or Quit without saving changes.
The code is a main function that has a while loop.
The while loop will continue to run until the user enters a choice in the cin>>choice; statement.
The first line of the code declares Bus_Manegment_System as an object of type Bus.
The second line of the code prints "cls" which is short for clear screen.
This command is used to clear any previous output on the screen and start fresh with new text.
The third line of the code prints "Bus Menagment System."
This would be what you see on your screen after running this program for the first time, but it could also be changed to whatever you want if you wanted to change it later on
